<p class="text-Header white thin-underline-orange">About Me</p>
<br>
<p class="text-Body white">Hi, I'm <span class="cyan">Kevin Lee</span>!</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white">I am a current <span class="pink">Software Engineer at Microsoft</span>, having just joined in the summer of 2017. I graduated from the University of Michigan, and studied <span class="pink">Computer Science with a minor in Music</span>. My major and minor accurately reflect my interests; I am a creative and analytical student who is passionate about <span class="pink">Software Engineering and the Creative Arts</span>.</p><br>

<p class="text-body-fira white word-wrap justified"><span class="orange"><b>> </b>Software Engineering:</span> I had my first "Hello World" experience just three years ago, and that has changed my life. I adore the problem-solving and puzzle-cracking aspect of software engineering and have had two software engineering internships ever since. Currently, my home for learning and practicing software engineering is with <span class="green">Microsoft</span>, specifically working in <span class="green">Outlook Desktop</span>.</p><br>\

<p class="text-Body white"><span class="orange">Creative Arts</span>: Music keeps me <i>sane</i>. My primary instrument is the <span class="green">two-string Chinese fiddle: the Erhu</span>, and secondaries would be the piano and violin. <span class="green">Music theory and composition</span>, however, is where my heart lies in music. It's a wonderful subject, infinitely complex, and has intrigued me ever since I first learned the Circle of Fifths.</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white"><span class="orange">Extracurriculars</span>: I am currently an Instructional Aide for <span class="green">EECS 183: "Elementary Programming Concepts"</span> at this university and am a board member on the <span class="green">College of Engineering's Undergraduate Student Advisory Board</span>, helping represent CS-LSA for all undergraduates. Outside of school, I have to admit that video games are pretty neat! I'm an avid gamer in my free time.</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white">Sincere thank you for visiting my website! I hope you have a wonderful time exploring here. :)<br><br>Best,<br><span class="cyan">Kevin Lee</span></p>

<br>
<p class="text-Body white">Hi, I'm <span class="cyan">Kevin Lee</span>!</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white">I am a newly graduated <span class="pink">alumni from the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor</span>. During my time there, I studied <span class="pink">Computer Science with a minor in Music</span>. My major and minor accurately reflect my interests; I am a creative and analytical individual who is passionate about <span class="pink">Software Engineering and the Creative Arts</span>.</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white"><span class="orange">Software Engineering</span>: Creativity and logic, a perfect mix! I had my first "Hello World" experience just three years ago, and have had two software engineering internships since then. I enjoy the problem-solving and puzzle-cracking aspect of software engineering, and will soon be working <span class="green">full-time with Microsoft</span> in Seattle in Summer '17!</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white"><span class="orange">Creative Arts</span>: Music keeps me <i>sane</i>. My primary instrument is the <span class="green">two-string Chinese fiddle: the Erhu</span>, and secondaries would be the piano and violin. <span class="green">Music theory and composition</span>, however, is where my heart lies in music. It's a wonderful subject, infinitely complex, and has intrigued me ever since I first learned the Circle of Fifths.</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white"><span class="orange">Extracurriculars</span>: During my time in unversitiy, I was an Instructional Aide for <span class="green">EECS 183: "Elementary Programming Concepts"</span> and a board member on the <span class="green">College of Engineering's Undergraduate Student Advisory Board</span>, helping represent CS-LSA for all undergraduates. I love mentoring, teaching, and aiding others in their endeavors! Outside of school, I have to admit that video games are pretty neat! I'm an avid gamer in my free time.</p><br>

<p class="text-Body white">Sincere thank you for visiting my website! I hope you have a wonderful time exploring here. :)<br><br>Best,<br><span class="cyan">Kevin Lee</span></p>
